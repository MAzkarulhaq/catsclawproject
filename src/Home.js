                For a long time, the Dogs have been a dominant driving force of
                crypto leaving cats as a mere after thought. After some time,
                the Cats decided to band together to compete against the Dog
                Ecosystem and claw their way back to the top. Therefore $CLAW
                was created. $CLAW aims to be a large driver in the cryptosphere
                with upcoming NFTs, Metaverse, P2E Games, and much much more.
